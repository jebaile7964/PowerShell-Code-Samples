# Software Configuration Management Samples

#### Push-DesktopPackages

This script demonstrates how simple chocolatey package management is when trying to install a package on multiple servers.
while the code is not very hard to master, it eliminates hours of wasted time manually provisioning each server.  The
script can also be written into a workflow to install each package in parallel.

#### Create-CloudRDPIcons

This script automates the creation of RDP files with a couple of gui elements and a bit of regex. It accepts csv input requests other data via the gui elements. After all the data is gathered, the regex operations start and a for loop iterates through the csv data, creating folders and icons for each new user.
