# Cloud Icon Creation

This script automates the creation of RDP files with a couple of gui elements and a bit of regex.  It accepts csv input
requests other data via the gui elements.  After all the data is gathered, the regex operations start and a for loop iterates
through the csv data, creating folders and icons for each new user.
